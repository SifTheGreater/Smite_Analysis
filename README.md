# Smite_Analysis
A Data analysis with some ML models on the data gotten from the Hi Rez Video Games SMITE

## GOAL

This is a long form project i was working on with the following goals.
- I wanted to understand how to work with an APi and be able to pull data effectivly
- I wanted to be able to store alrge amounts of data into a personal SQL database
- I wanted to be able to use this SQL database effectivly to build up some data analysis knowledge#
- I wanted to apply my data science knowledge to anser some questions about the game that would eb easier to answer with the data

## STRUCTURE
In the root folder of the database I have all of the current files, 
- API_Pull -> is a notebook that has the logic to pull from the Hi Rez API and put the data into the SMITE.db database
- SMITE.db -> this is the database file, unforunatly it is not on github as it exceeds the file size limit for Github LFS of 2 GBs. Currently working on a way to include it. if someone wants a copy feel freee to email me at mageena@tcd.ie and ill send a copy of the current file to you
- General -> This is a notebook where i do some basic EDA and have coded in an algorithm that calculates the average stats of gods over a period of games for a higher view(looking to imporve speed)
- MMR_ranges -. very quick analysis on the MMR ranges of different Queues, identifys when people of different skill are playing.
- Table_Creation -> File that initilises the three tables in the database.
